# Scrumbledore
Repository for project group 12 at the TU Delft, consisting of David Alderliesten, Jesse Tilro, Floris Doolaard, Jeroen Meijer, and Niels Warnars.

# Controls
Due to the lack of an in-game settings menu (which is being worked on), the controls for the game can be found below:

* Up Arrow = Jump.
* Left Arrow = Move Left.
* Right Arrow = Move Right.
* Z = Shoot projectile/bubble.
